# LOCCNet-Entanglement-Distillation-Using-Qiskit

Project to explore the 2021 research paper by Zhao et al. with the title: "Practical distributed quantum information processing with LOCCNet". This project is replicating the functionality of the LOCCNet Machine Learning approach for entanglement distillation using IBM's Qiskit.
